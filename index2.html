				Graphic design has a monumental impact on society; we know that. From websites to logos, TV ads and mobile applications, almost everything involves graphic design of some&nbsp;sort.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a graphic designer, my job is rather important. I am in a position of influence just like any other designer out there; we are paid to provide aesthetics that ultimately lead to the awareness, sale or use of a product. We have the ability to change people’s minds, the ability to alter a company’s public image. You’d imagine that to get the best results, the people responsible for this should pretty accurately reflect&nbsp;society.

					According to the <a href= "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">Department for Culture, Media & Sport</a>, in 2013, the UK creative economy had 178,000 jobs in Design (product, graphic and fashion): 93.3 percent of those jobs were filled by those who are white, that means 6.7 percent were filled by all other ethnicities combined.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let’s say your agency has a team of 100 designers, 6.7 percent of that team would be non-white. If you had a smaller team of 10 designers, only 0.6 percent of that team would be non-white: totalling just over half a person.
